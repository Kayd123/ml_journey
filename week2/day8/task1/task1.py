# Task: Library Book Records
# Create a file called books.txt.
# Write at least 5 book titles into it, one per line.
# Read the file line by line and print the book titles with line numbers, like this:
    # 1. Harry Potter
    # 2. The Hobbit

# Append two more book titles to the file (without overwriting).
# Read the entire file again as a single string and print it.
# Handle errors gracefully using try/except:
# If the file does not exist, print "File not found." instead of crashing.
# ðŸ‘‰ Bonus: After appending, count and print how many books are now in the file.
