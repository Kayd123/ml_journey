# Task: Student Records
# Instructions:
# Create a file called students.txt.
# Write at least 5 student names into it, one per line.
# Example:
# Alice
# Brian
# Catherine
# David
# Esther
# Read the file line by line and print the student names with line numbers.
# Example output:
# 1. Alice
# 2. Brian
# 3. Catherine
# 4. David
# 5. Esther
# Append 2 new student names to the file (without overwriting).
# Read the entire file as a single string and print it.
# Count how many students are now in the file and print the total.
# Handle errors gracefully with try/except. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, print "File not found."
# âš¡ Bonus Challenge:
# After appending, print only the new students that were added.
# ðŸ‘‰ Your task: Write a Python script student_records.py to complete the above.
